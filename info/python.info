### Installing particular version of Python
# Remove a version of package -- sudo apt-get  remove python3

# Installing sepcific version of python
    sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev
    cd ~/Downloads/
    wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tgz
    tar -xvf Python-2.7.5.tgz
    cd Python-2.7.5

    ./configure
    make
    make install
    sudo checkinstall

# How to install github3
    => Using PIP
        pip install github3.py==0.9.5  (this will install particular version of package)

    => from source
        wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/g/github3.py/github3.py-0.9.5.tar.gz#md5=a20c3af33337633d60e0e0a0ed10398d
        tar -zxvf github3.py-0.9.5.tar.gz
        cd github3py*
        python setup.py install

###  Package/Modules handling
# Python modules are 3 types. pure python, native, or built-in
  Searching modules  - Python looks for the packages in sys.path which is populated using PYTHONENV, installation dependent default paths. The sys.path can be manipulated in program.

    import sys
    print '\n'.join(sys.path)
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    /usr/lib/python2.7/
    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages



 Python module file location - C modules don't have file attribute as they are statically linked to the interpreter. Ex sys, imp etc.
    import jenkinsapi
    jenkinsapi.__file__   #displays location of python module

# imp module can access entire import system
    import imp
    imp.find_module('jenkinsapi')
    imp.load_source('module_name',<module_file_path>)

# Display each module loaded
    python -v
    >>> import jenkinsapi #displays location of jenkinsapi

# site-packages - is a directory where you install 3rd party,additional packages , including your own reusable code. (i.e., not part of the core python distribution). This can have multiple directories.
    import site
    site.getpackages()



## Installing python modules
Python module can be installed in 3 ways

    * using easy_install  (available by default in latest python versions)
    * using PIP (available by default in latest python versions)
    * using source code , download source code and run "python setup.py install"

Ubuntu installs pip packages to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages and apt packages to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

#easy_install
    Easy install is a package manager for python and provides a standard format for ditributing python programs and libraries (based on python egg wrappers)
    Bundled with setuptools and uses egg wrappers
    By default looks in Python Package Index (PyPI) for desired packages

    Drawbacks
    Not a fully fledged package manager. It cannot list local packages nor update them.

#pip
    Better than easy_install
    Used to install/remove/update packages written in Python
    Can list local packages and update any package


    PIP 1.5.4 has issue with security certificate

    apt-get install python-pip
    (or)
    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-7.1.0.tar.gz#md5=d935ee9146074b1d3f26c5f0acfd120e  ## From source

    wget  https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.2.1.tar.gz
    tar xvfz pip-1.2.1.tar.gz
    cd pip-1.2.1
    python setup.py install --record files.txt  # This gives list of files installed


    pip list # list of installed packages
    pip show <pkg_name> # details of installed package
    pip install <package_name>  (or) -U <package_name> # updates package
    pip install <wheel_file>
    pip install -U pip  # This upgrades pip using pip



# setuptools
    A python module which is required for easy_install and pip

# Eggs
    Packaging format for Python. This is not official
    Eggs allows to add additional information with python project, allows dependencies to be checked , allows projects to provide plugins for other projects
    Eggs are to Python as Jars are to Java

# wheel
    Packaging format for Python. Has official PEP

    pip install wheel
    python -m wheel install wheel_file.whl

# Egg vs Wheel
    Egg is distribution format and runtime installation format (contains pyc files)
    Wheel is only distribution format (compatible with Python2  and Python3). Creates pyc files as part of installation to match the interpreter used in system
    Wheel is versioned


#### Python language
### Basics
Python uses interpreter for compiling/running the program. Python gives name __main__ to the module which is called as main program.
Python is dynamically typed language but also strongly typed language
Data types: int, long,float, complex and boolean

# Buit in object types:
    Lists -> mutable, ordered , mutable, can have different types of data and can have lists in them. [1,2,3]
    Tuples ->immutable. (1,2,3)
    dict -> {key:value}
    set -> unique elements, unordered
    str -> sequence of characters, immutable
    unicode -> sequence of unicode encoded characters

# BIF (built in functions)
    int , float, str  - converts data types
    id  - gives memory location of the data type
    enumerate
    isinstance
    typeof

# import examples
    import lib # all elements imported. dot prefix required. no name space conflict. preferred way.
    from lib import * # all functions imported. no dot prefix needed. may have name space conflict.
    from lib import x  # imports single element x from lib. No prefix required
    from lib import x as y # x() y()

Int, float, string , tuples are immutable. i.e. memory location will change after changing the value.
array,list,dictionary,classes, class instances are not immutable.

# range vs xrange
    range creats a list with elements in memory. xrange is a sequence object and evaluates lazily
    python 3.x range is same as python 2.x xrange

# Library and modules
The tool 2to3.py converts python 2.x programs to 3.x

### OOPs concepts (inheritance, encapsulation)

### Exception handling

### Multi threading

### Data structures

### DB connectivity

### Web development

### Jython


#### Python vs Java
    similar to stringbuffer in java


#### Miscellaneous
# Because of certificate validation error, Verify is assigned to False in package code
    requests/session.py

# ~/.netrc  is used to store github parameters
