For instance, you can design a tic-tac-toe game: Display 9 gray buttons laid out in a 3x3 grid. The first player clicks a button. You change the color of that button to red and you set a variable to remember that choice. The second player clicks a different button. You turn that button to green and again you remember that decision. The first player picks yet another button and you resume the same action as before until either a player managed to align 3 buttons in a row, a column or diagonally ore each button have been clicked. Then you display a pop-up to announce which player won or an even-game.
