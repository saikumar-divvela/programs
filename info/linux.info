linux kernel and internals
---------------------------
kernel manages resources of linux os (I/O, process, memory, device, file system)
the layer is like this hardware <- kernel <- shell/application
->shell is a command langauge interpreter, takes the commands in english and executes the commands.
it is not part of system kernel but uses kernel to exeute commands and create files..
List of installed shells in system /etc/shells.
->A process is program to perform specific job or an instance of running command with PID


--------
commands
--------
vi vim view touch  cal date time who whoami which cat ls mv cp rm sort unique diff tr  "type -p <command_name>"
grep awk sed wc cut gksu #opens gui run window# env
echo $SHELL

uname -r (linux kernel version)
uname -m (architecture)
cat /proc/version
lsb_release -a  (ubuntu version)
dmesg | grep Linux  (all boot messages are stored in dmesg)

/etc/fstab contains all mount points i.e all directories tht are mounted
/proc/partitions

scp local.txt your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory
scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory 

ssh commands generating keys
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f <filename>
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f <filename>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f <filename>

===> link
hard link 
    ln <filename> <hardlink>
All the links share same inode number. The file is deleted only when all the links are deleted.
how to find all links -> ls -i  && find / -inum <inode_number> -print
symbolic link 
    ln -s <filename> <softlink>
Each link has different inode number. After the original file is deleted then sym links don't work.

===> Setting system path

===> hardware information
lscpu - cpu details 
lshw  - details about cpu, memory, network adapters, disks, usbs 
lspci - lists all pci buses, and hardware coonnected to those buses. (hw like graphics card,network adapter,usb ports, sata controllers)
lsusb - list of usbs
lsblk - list block devices
df fidk mount
free -- to check RAM
dmidecode
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/meminfo
/proc/partitions
hdparm

==>environment variables/system path
To set for all users 
/etc/environment 
don't use /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc
/etc/profile.d -> The scripts under this directory are run during the system start up. create a script, with exported variables, in this directory

To set for current user
~/.profile  --> best place
~/.bash_profile or ~./bash_login --> only for bash shells
~/.bashrc

To apply the changes run
source ~/.profile


==> process related
"ps -ax -ag" kill killall top pstree

==> package related
apt-get install/remove  #install/removes the packages
apt-get update #Gets the latest versions for installed packages but doesn't install anything
apt-get upgrade <package> #upgrades all/specific packages based on the updated info
apt-cache search <pkg> #Searches for the package in configured repositories

dpkg --get-selections  #List all softwares installed in system
dpkg -i <pkg_file> # Installs the package
dpkg -r <package> # removes the package, doesn't remove configuration files
dpkg -P <package> # Purge the package, removes everything including configuration files

==>Kernel
sysctl # configure kernel parameters at runtime
e2fsck # repairs the file system. doesn't work on mounted file system.
resize2fs # resizes the file system ext2,3,4.  Enlarges or shrinks the file system located on device.


==>Ipaddress / networking commands
--->ipaddress: 2 ways to set ip address  network-manager and ifconfig
network-manager and ifconfig are not compatible

#1 ifconfig
change /etc/network/interfaces to add/modify interface details
/etc/init.d/networking  start/stop to enable/disable the interfaces defined in the file
ifup and ifdown uses this configuration for bringing down or up the interfaces. They use ifconfig internally.

#2 NetworkManager 
    Won't configure interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces
    Configured ip address is available in /etc/NetworkManager/systemconnections
    Use network settings GUI and set the ip address 
    Networkmanager is frontend to iproute,dhclient,wpa_suppliant and ppp
    Start/stop the network manager service to enable/disable the interface 
    
    /etc/init.d/networking stop

    sudo start/stop network-manager
    sudo service network-manager stop/start

ifconfig doesn't use the interfaces info in file /etc/network/interfaces

you can also use ifconfig <interface> up/down to enable/disable the interface


Networkmanager and ifconfig are not compatible and doesn't use the interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces

/etc/network/interfaces  #Ip address configuration
sudo ifconfig eth0 up/down #bring up/down port
ifup eth0 #bring UP port
ifdown eth0 #bring down port
route #display routine table

iptables
netstat -nat # active internet connections
netstat -tulp # display open ports
netstat -i # display network interfaces 
ufw status # shows the firewall status
nmap -P0 destinationipaddress

--> setting up network bridge
create a bridge with ipaddress and don't connect real interface to bridge

brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 eth0
brctl show
ip link set dev br0 up

ip link set dev br0 down
brctl delbr br0
ip addr add dev br0 192.168.66.66/24

iptables -I FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-is-bridged -j ACCEPT


==>Commands to check status of xorg server
xeyes
Xorg
X11 -> needs X server and windo manager,client screens
init 5 # command to start GUI from command prompt

==>Troubleshooting
Entering grub menu:When os is booting press esc/shift button

==>Setting up new linux system
#Change the connecting server in software center if apt-get doesn't work
#Set the proxy url in internet
#Import the certificate in firefox to avoid the https invalid certificate error

Unix concepts
---------------
---> wayland
This is a just display server protocol that is intended to replace X windows system.
Communication happens between compositor and its clients. A compositing window manager
gives each application its own memory buffer and then composites all these memory buffer 
into an image in display memory.  The compositor can be a linux display server, an X applicaton
or a wayland client.
Weston is reference implementation of wayland protocol. Weston is fast, small,and runs on mobile and embedded devices. 
Composite windo manager supports all special effects,2D,3D animations. Ex: Xfwm,Cairo,KWin,Mutter

Histroy
XFree 86 (X window system or X11 or X)
Xorg ->Fork of X11.Later the functinality like memory management, command scheduling  and mode setting moved to kernel, but still Xorg is a memory and cpu hog. 

---> crosstalk
Crosswalk is a HTML5 runtime built on open source. You can deploy the mobile html5 application with its
own runtime without a dependency on native webview that is on device.
so application can run in different android versions, also on ios,without differences.

--->X window system or X11 or X
Uses client-server model. client can be remote. X client may emulate an X server by provding display services to clients. known as x nesting. examples are Xnest and Xephyr


------------------
GIT
-----------------
to clone a project
git clone <source_url>  <target_dir>
git add <filenames>
git commit -m <commit_text>
git rm <file-name> # to remove the file from staging and working dir
gir rm --cached <file-name> # to remove the file only from staging
git diff  # to see the changes between modified and staged vesrions
git diff --staged # to see the changes between staged and repository
git mv <file_name_old> <file_name_new>
git log --pretty=oneline --graph

-----------
User/Group management
------------
Creating a new group and adding user to the group
    addgroup gerrit
    adduser --system --home /home/gerrit --shell /bin/bash --ingroup gerrit2 gerrit

To add user to existing group
sudo adduser <user> <group>

removing user
userdel -r <username>
deluser –force <username>
deluser –remove-home/–remove-all-files/–backup-to DIR <username>


#remove user from group
    sudo deluser <user> <group>

#list the groups the user belongs
    groups <username>  
#changing the group of file
    chgrp group_name file/directory_name 
#changing the owner of file
    chown <user_name> <file>

--> changing password as root
passwd <username>

----------------------
Mysql
----------------------
installing mysql
apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common
apt-get install mysql-server
apt-get install mysql-client

create database
dop database <dbname>
drop user <name>@<host>

-------------------
Service management
-------------------
service command executes a script which is defined in /etc/init.d/ or an upstart job defined in /etc/init
service --status-all
service <servicename> start/stop/status/--full-restart
start/stop/status <servicename>
-------------------------
Important files
------------------------
/etc/shells -> contains list of installed shells
/etc/profile.d -> contains the startup scripts run for all users
~/.profile -> user profile
~/.bash_profile -> user shell profile
~/.bash_login -> executed when login to the shell
/etc/fstab -> contains all mount points i.e all directories which are mounted
/proc/partitions -> contains all partitions details
----------------------------
Add certificate to root user
----------------------------
1) Create a directory for extra CA certificates in /usr/share/ca-certificates:
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra

2) Copy the CA .crt file to this directory:
    sudo cp foo.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra/foo.crt

3) Let Ubuntu add the .crt file's path relative to /usr/share/ca-certificates to /etc/ca-certificates.conf:
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificate
