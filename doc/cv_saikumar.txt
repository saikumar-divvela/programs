Minor Project in M.Tech
Title: Implementation of Digital signature using ESIGN Algorithm                    
Description:  Project deals with providing security features like authentication and integrity to messages by enabling creator of message to attach a secret code known as digital signature. Software is created for generating 128 bit unique hash code for variable length message using hash function MD5 and for generating digital signature which is obtained by encrypting hash code using ESIGN algorithm.  At the receiving side the digital signature is decrypted and verified with the hash code of message. If they match message is not tampered and receiver is certain of sender. If they don’t match message is tampered by intruder and is invalid.
Platform: Java, Windows
	
Dissertation in M.Tech
Title: A Watermarking Algorithm for Ownership Verification of Digital Images
Description: Project deals with implementation of wavelet-based watermarking algorithm for inserting watermark into images and detecting watermark in the image, for ownership verification of digital images. Copyright information, which is unique to an organization or owner of digital images, is inserted into images. Copyright information acts as the watermark for the image.  Owner of the images will have private control on the watermark with the help of secret keys. A set of filters bank, which acts as a secret key for image, is generated from spectral factorization of polynomial. The owner searches for counterfeiters of his images and applies detection procedure on his images to find watermark. If the owner finds watermark the counterfeiter can be charged for illegal use of images.
Platform: C, Windows
